I've been working on the *new session* dialog. Now it is a wizard with
three pages. The main novelties are that:

- You can now select more than one student list. All of them are used
  when detecting the student id.

- You can now enter the scores for correct and incorrect answers. If
  the exam configuration file already contains the scores, you'll see
  them as default values. In addition, you can let Eyegrade choose
  appropriate values for you, by just entering the maximum score of
  the exam and choosing whether incorrect answers should penalize or
  not.

You can try the new dialog in the development branch at GitHub, and
see it this `screenshots gallery </galleries/screenshots-new-gui-2/>`_!

This new dialog will appear in the 0.2 release. I have in mind for a
future release the possibility of entering the exam configuration from
the new session dialog, as an alternative to reading it from a
file. This may be handy for users who do not create the exam with the
command line tools that Eyegrade provides.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
