I'm programming from scratch the graphical user interface of
Eyegrade. The old user interface uses Pygame. It allowed me to build
the first interface of the program very quickly, but now its lack of
graphical components (buttons, dialogues, menus, etc.) was preventing me
from programming a more user-friendly interface.  I've decided to use
`PyQt <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/>`_ for the
new interface. Why PyQt? I programmed a game with Qt in C++ many years
ago, and I liked the library a lot. With the python bindings it is
even easier to use.

The new user interface will be released with Eyegrade 0.2 (hopefully,
before before the end of January). In the mean time, the brave can
give it a try (it is available at the `development branch of
Eyegrade at GitHub
<https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade>`_). Suggestions are welcome
(just post a comment here or write me an email.) I have tested it only
in Linux, although it should work in Windows too. Remember to install
PyQt (package *python-qt4* in Debian and Ubuntu).
