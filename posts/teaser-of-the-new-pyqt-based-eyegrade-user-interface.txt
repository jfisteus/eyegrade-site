I'm programming from scratch the graphical user interface of
Eyegrade. The old user interface uses Pygame. It allowed me to build
the first interface of the program very quickly, but its lack of
graphical components (buttons, dialogues, menus, etc.) was preventing me
from programming a more user-friendly interface.  I've decided to use
`PyQt <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/>`_ for the
new interface. Why PyQt? I programmed a game with Qt in C++ many years
ago, and I liked the library a lot. With the python bindings, it is
even easier to use.

The new user interface will be released with Eyegrade 0.2 (hopefully,
before the end of January). Check the first `screenshots gallery
</galleries/screenshots-new-gui-1/>`_!

Right now the program does more or less the same as the old interface,
but it will be easier to add new features in the future.

The brave can give it a try before the release (it is available at the
`development branch of Eyegrade at GitHub
<https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade>`_). Suggestions are welcome
(just post a comment here or write me an email.) I have tested it only
in Linux, although it should work in Windows too. If you try it, notice that:

- You need PyQt (package *python-qt4* in Debian and Ubuntu).

- There is no `src` directory anymore. Following the Python
  conventions, the Python files are now directly under the `eyegrade`
  subdirectory of the main directory of the project.

- The main program does not receive command line arguments. The `.eye`
  file and student list are selected at the *new session* dialog.
