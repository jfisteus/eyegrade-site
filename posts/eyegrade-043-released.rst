I've just released Eyegrade 0.4.3.
This release fixes a bug
that made the functionality that exports grades fail
when the program is run
with the Python 2.6 version I distribute for Windows.
Linux users with a reasonably recent version of Python
were not affected.
This is the only change with respect to version 0.4.2.

If you have installed Eyegrade through *git*, you can easily update
the program by executing the command
*git pull* from inside the directory in which Eyegrade is installed.
