.. slug: eyegrade-04-released

I've released eyegrade 0.4 (actually, eyegrade 0.4.2 after a couple of
minor changes and a bug fix). There is only one main change in this
release with respect to the 0.3 series, the ability to export grade
listings from the user interface.

When you select in the menu *Exams / Export grade listing* you get a dialog
like the following one that allows you to configure the export options:

This new feature is easier to use and more flexible than the
`mix_grades` script that was available in the previous versions. The
script is now obsolete and will probably be removed in the future.
