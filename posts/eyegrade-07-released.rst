Eyegrade 0.7 has been released!
This release includes two main changes from the point of view
of the final user:

- Improved algorithms for the detection of manuscript digits and cell crosses,
  based on `support vector machines
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine>`_.
  The system is much more precise now than in previous versions of Eyegrade.
  This feature is based on the valuable contribution
  of `Jorge Arq√ºello <https://github.com/rarguelloF>`_,
  who developed its first version.

- Distribution of binary packages built with
  `PyInstaller <http://www.pyinstaller.org/>`_,
  and a Windows installer built with
  `NSIS <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page>`_.

Installation is much easier now than before.
Check the new
`quick start guide <../../quick-start-guide.html>`_
for instructions,
also accessible from the
`documentation page <../../documentation.html>`_.

Access the binary files for this release
at the `downloads page <../../download.html>`_.
