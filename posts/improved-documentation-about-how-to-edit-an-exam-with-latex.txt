The *official* way of editting your exams for Eyegrade
consists of creating an XML file with the questions,
running on it the `create_exam` script provided by Eyegrade
and compiling the resulting files with LaTeX
in order to get the final PDF documents.

Although exams can also be edited
with a word processor such as OpenOffice or Microsoft Word
(see `Creating the exams in a word processor
</doc/user-manual/#creating-the-exams-in-a-word-processor>`_),
following the official way has some advantages:

- Eyegrade shuffles the questions
  and produces several models with different question orderings.

- Eyegrade creates the exam configuration file (the `.eye` file)
  automatically.

- LaTeX-style equations may be used inside the questions.

However, editing an XML file and dealing with LaTeX
may scare some users
that are more used to graphical word processors.
In order to make the procedure more approachable,
the user manual describes now more in depth how to edit exams
the official way in the section
`Editing exams </doc/user-manual/#editing-exams>`_.
Suggestions on how to improve that section further
are most welcome.
