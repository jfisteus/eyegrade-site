The fix in Eyegrade 0.6.3
for issue `#108 <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues/108>`_
(the accept button remains sometimes disabled
in the *edit student id* dialog)
didn't actually fix the problem in some situations.
I've released Eyegrade 0.6.4 with a fix
that I hope finally solves the problem.

As always, you can update with ``git pull``
if you installed Eyegrade through *git*.
