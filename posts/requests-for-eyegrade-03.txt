.. slug: requests-for-eyegrade-03

I'm planning the next major release (0.3) of Eyegrade for
September. There are some features I have in mind, but listening to
the users from time to time does not harm ;) If there is a feature you
are especially interested in, just let me know by commenting on this
post.

Apart from some polishing here and there, these are things I'm
thinking about:

- Right now, you can review and fix detection errors in an exam only
  at the moment you scan it. What if you discover an error later on?
  It think it would be great if the interface allowed you to open a
  grading session anytime later and use the same reviewing/fixing
  features.  This feature would probably include a list of students
  and grades in the interface, so that you can quickly access the exam
  of a specific student.

- A user interface for entering the questions of an exam, creating the
  PDFs, etc. This would probably include dropping LaTeX in favor of
  something else (my main option is the `ReportLab library
  <http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/>`_). Using the
  current command-line interface and LaTeX would still be possible,
  but not the preferred method.

- Making life easier for users that only want to use Eyegrade for
  grading, but not for creating the exams. I include here features
  such as creating a `.eye` file through guided dialogues or creating
  the PDF of a personalized answer sheet in the user interface.  It's
  about time to close `issue 36
  <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues/36>`_.

- Adapting the user interface for multiple languages. I can start with
  an English, Spanish and Galician interface, and wait for volunteers
  to translate it to other tongues.

I won't have time for all the features in the list, so you can help me
to prioritize. Of course, you can also request features not in the
list ;)
