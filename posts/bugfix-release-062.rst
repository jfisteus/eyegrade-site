I've released Eyegrade 0.6.2 today.
This release fixes a severe bug when grading exams without scoring
and fixes also issues
`#104 <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues/104>`_
and `#108 <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues/108>`_.

As always, you can update with ``git pull``
if you installed Eyegrade through *git*.
