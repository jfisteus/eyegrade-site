I've released Eyegrade 0.6.3 today.
This release fixes issues
`#108 <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues/108>`_
(again, I hope that it's for good this time)
and `#111 <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues/111>`_.

As always, you can update with ``git pull``
if you installed Eyegrade through *git*.
