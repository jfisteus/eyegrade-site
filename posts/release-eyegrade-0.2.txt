Eyegrade 0.2 has been released! It features the shiny new PyQt-based
user interface that I showed in previous posts.

The `Eyegrade User Manual
<http://www.it.uc3m.es/jaf/eyegrade/doc/user-manual/>`_ contains
up-to-date instructions for using the new interface. If you have
Eyegrade 0.1.x installed, you need to install PyQt and change the
value of an environment variable. See the `section about upgrading
Eyegrade
<http://www.it.uc3m.es/jaf/eyegrade/doc/user-manual/#upgrading-from-eyegrade-0-1-x-to-eyegrade-0-2>`_.

This new user interface will facilitate other usability improvements
in the future, such as the possibility of reviewing previously graded
exams, editing the student list, writing grades to disk in several
orders and formats, etc.

If you experience problems with this new version, please let me know
by commenting on this blog or `posting an issue at GitHub
<https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues?sort=created&state=open>`_.
