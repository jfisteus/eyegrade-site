I've just moved Eyegrade to a new Web location at `eyegrade.org
<http://eyegrade.org/>`_. These are the important links:

- Project homepage: `<http://eyegrade.org/>`_

- User manual: `<http://eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/>`_

- Blog: `<http://eyegrade.org/blog/>`_

- RSS feed: `<http://eyegrade.org/blog/rss.xml>`_

Requests for the old addresses will automatically be redirected to the
new location. However, the old server may be down for some periods of
August. In fact, the frequent downtimes of the old hosting are one of
the main reasons for the change. During those downtime periods
redirections won't work. However, the new addresses will work properly
even in that case.

The new website is hosted at the `GitHub Pages
<http://pages.github.com/>`_ service. My experience so far with this
service has been very satisfactory. The availability of the website
with the new hosting will definitely be much better.
