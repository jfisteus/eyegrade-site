Videos
===================

Khuất Văn Quyên,
an eyegrade user from Vietnam,
has created and published the following video tutorial in Youtube
covering topics such installing eyegrade on Windows,
using it to grade exams
and creating answer forms in Microsoft Word.
Texts are in Vietnamese, but don't worry if you don't speak that language,
because you should be able to follow the video
and get most of the information despite of that.
Thanks a lot for this contribution!
