Latest stable release:
-----------------------

The latest stable release is Eyegrade 0.7.
The recommended way of installation,
depending on your operating system, is:

- Windows installer:
  `eyegrade-setup-0.7.exe <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/releases/download/eyegrade-0.7/eyegrade-setup-0.7.exe>`_

- Linux portable binary files:
  `eyegrade-0.7-bin-linux.tar.gz <https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/releases/download/eyegrade-0.7/eyegrade-0.7-bin-linux.tar.gz>`_
  (these binaries should be compatible with any reasonably recent distribution,
  more or less from 2014 or more recent)

There is no support for Mac OS/X yet.
Volunteers for finding and documenting how to install it
on that platform are welcome.

If you are trying Eyegrade for the first time,
